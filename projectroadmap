[x] I found a python project in github that has a full inventory management system with a gui. It also has the ability to print invoice in .pdf format. 
[x] use tkinter. 
[x] record new product entry.
[x] add GUI
[ ] add a varience system on top of this existing code that will show actual vs ideal inventory at the end of the day.
[ ] add variance calculator
[ ] re-arrange product ID
